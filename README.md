# Practical-1: Kotlin Programming Concepts

This project demonstrates various **core Kotlin programming concepts** including variables, type conversion, user input, control statements, functions, recursion, arrays, ArrayList operations, classes, constructors, and operator overloading.

Each file contains a simple program that focuses on a specific Kotlin concept along with its output screenshots.
